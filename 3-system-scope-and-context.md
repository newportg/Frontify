# 3, System Scope and Context

## Business Context

A internal user will have the ability to pass property, text and image information, to this service and receive a brochure that complies with our current marketing guidelines. The user will also have the ability to specify if they want the brochure to be autogenerated or created by hand. The quality and speed being a trade off the transaction owner will have to make. The MarComm(marketing and communications) department will create brochure templates and maintain them to the current standards.
